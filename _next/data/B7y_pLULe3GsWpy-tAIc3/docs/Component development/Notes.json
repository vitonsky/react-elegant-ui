It simplify control on many entities and decrease code complexity.\n\nAll components which use similar interfaces should be unify, make common interface and use it.\n\nAll blocks must have property `innerRef` for forwarding ref objects to block wrapper.\n\n***\n\n## Use root node instead document\n\nWhen component use inside ShadowDOM, its root is not `document` and property `event.target` from event of `document` will contain ShadowDOM wrapper, but not real target inside this.\n\nConsider this, and use `document` only for really global event handlers without root context, such as release mouse or button, but when need access to `event.target` - use `node.getRootNode()`, for component stay work in ShadowDOM.\n","navigation":[{"title":"Introduction","child":[{"title":"About","path":"/docs/Introduction/About"},{"title":"Getting started","path":"/docs/Introduction/GettingStarted"},{"title":"Package structure","path":"/docs/Introduction/PackageStructure"},{"title":"Component architecture","path":"/docs/Introduction/ComponentArchitecture"},{"title":"Component file structure","path":"/docs/Introduction/ComponentFileStructure"},{"title":"Theming","path":"/docs/Introduction/Theming"},{"title":"Tokens","path":"/docs/Introduction/Tokens"}]},{"title":"Component development","child":[{"title":"Introduction","path":"/docs/Component development/Introduction"},{"title":"Component naming","path":"/docs/Component development/ComponentNaming"},{"title":"Design system","path":"/docs/Component development/DesignSystem"},{"title":"Notes","path":"/docs/Component development/Notes"}]},{"title":"Contributing","child":[{"title":"Contributing rules","path":"/docs/Contributing/ContributingRules"},{"title":"CLA","path":"/docs/Contributing/CLA"}]}]},"pages":[],"__N_SSG":true}
