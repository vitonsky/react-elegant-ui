Themes class names follow the BEM methodology.Actually, properties may be group to any CSS entity, but this library use only classes.This architecture allow redefine views of components for each DOM node just by set theme on this node.A theme can contain any properties, both all properties of all components, and only colors or typography and other. You can mix themes to split use of colors and sizes.\n\nFor use themes browser must support CSS variables, but if you need to use UI kit for old browsers which is not support this (IE9 for example), you can compile CSS variables to static values.For this case you can use PostCSS plugin postcss-theme-fold.\n\nYou can use any tools to convert design tokens to themes such as design tokens it's just YAML files.Actually design tokens use references to other tokens and functions for transform values, but it not too hard to implement.This package is use a themekit tool which based on style-dictionary."
