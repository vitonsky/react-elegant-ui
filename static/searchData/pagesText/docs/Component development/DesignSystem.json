You can change specific tokens for any component instead change one token for all components.This way have one disadvantage in some cases - all common tokens never use in CSS and make useless traffic. It may be fix with optional removing common tokens while compile. But this also can be useful when you use CSS aliases and wanna to dynamic change values, cuz in this case you have to change only common token values.\n\nComponent tokens should not use literal values such as color or size, instead it use or modify common values.This allows to make global changes by change common tokens.You can use literal values for project defined tokens. It useful to personalization of design.\n\nNaming must be by meaning but not by value.For example color of error message should name  instead .\n\nToken name consists of parts and present a path in structure of design system.First part of the struct it's token namespace.\nNext parts - it's just path to token key in namespace.Example a component namespace:buttoniconmenutextareaTo simplify navigation a tokens need group by purpose.Typical groups:typo: typography tokens like size and color of textfillColor: background colors of block, outline, etcsize: group for few sizesGroup may present a list of values or other groups like states list:"
